"My gaming PC in it's current configuration.<br>
 Eventually I would like to upgrade the Graphics<br>
 Card to the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 and upgrade the<br>
 RAM to a minimum of 16GB.
 <br>
 <br>
 However, in it's current configuration this PC<br>
 has been a rock solid beast that has handled every<br>
 game I've thrown at it very well.
 <br>
 <br>
  I highly recommend this PC for anyone looking <br>
  for a good gaming PC at a pretty cost efficient price<br>
  as well compared to others I looked at."
